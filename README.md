Official Implementation of BlockNet and BD-EnKo

</div>

## Introduction

**BlockNet** is a new framework that summarizes block diagrams, working for both English and Korean. It combines detailed (local) and overall (global) information from the diagrams using a large language model (LLM). For local information, it uses an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithm that breaks the task into smaller parts. For global information, it uses a transformer model trained with a large block diagram dataset, without needing OCR.

**Donut** üç©, **Do**cume**n**t **u**nderstanding **t**ransformer, is a new method of document understanding that utilizes an OCR-free end-to-end Transformer model. Donut does not require off-the-shelf OCR engines/APIs, yet it shows state-of-the-art performances on various visual document understanding tasks, such as visual document classification or information extraction (a.k.a. document parsing). 
In addition, we present **SynthDoG** üê∂, **Synth**etic **Do**cument **G**enerator, that helps the model pre-training to be flexible on various languages and domains.

## Getting Started

### Data

This repository assumes the following structure of dataset:
```bash
> tree dataset_name
dataset_name
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.jsonl
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {image_path0}
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {image_path1}
‚îÇ             .
‚îÇ             .
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.jsonl
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {image_path0}
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {image_path1}
‚îÇ             .
‚îÇ             .
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.jsonl
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {image_path0}
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {image_path1}
              .
              .

> cat dataset_name/test/metadata.jsonl
{"file_name": {image_path0}, "ground_truth": "{\"gt_parse\": {ground_truth_parse}, ... {other_metadata_not_used} ... }"}
{"file_name": {image_path1}, "ground_truth": "{\"gt_parse\": {ground_truth_parse}, ... {other_metadata_not_used} ... }"}
     .
     .
```

- The structure of `metadata.jsonl` file is in [JSON Lines text format](https://jsonlines.org), i.e., `.jsonl`. Each line consists of
  - `file_name` : relative path to the image file.
  - `ground_truth` : string format (json dumped), the dictionary contains either `gt_parse` or `gt_parses`. Other fields (metadata) can be added to the dictionary but will not be used.
- `donut` interprets all tasks as a JSON prediction problem. As a result, all `donut` model training share a same pipeline. For training and inference, the only thing to do is preparing `gt_parse` or `gt_parses` for the task in format described below.

#### For Document Classification
The `gt_parse` follows the format of `{"class" : {class_name}}`, for example, `{"class" : "scientific_report"}` or `{"class" : "presentation"}`.
- Google colab demo is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xUDmLqlthx8A8rWKLMSLThZ7oeRJkDuU?usp=sharing).
- Gradio web demo is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nielsr/donut-rvlcdip).

#### For Document Information Extraction
The `gt_parse` is a JSON object that contains full information of the document image, for example, the JSON object for a receipt may look like `{"menu" : [{"nm": "ICE BLACKCOFFEE", "cnt": "2", ...}, ...], ...}`.
- More examples are available at [CORD dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/naver-clova-ix/cord-v2).
- Google colab demo is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o07hty-3OQTvGnc_7lgQFLvvKQuLjqiw?usp=sharing).
- Gradio web demo is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-cord-v2).

#### For Document Visual Question Answering
The `gt_parses` follows the format of `[{"question" : {question_sentence}, "answer" : {answer_candidate_1}}, {"question" : {question_sentence}, "answer" : {answer_candidate_2}}, ...]`, for example, `[{"question" : "what is the model name?", "answer" : "donut"}, {"question" : "what is the model name?", "answer" : "document understanding transformer"}]`.
- DocVQA Task1 has multiple answers, hence `gt_parses` should be a list of dictionary that contains a pair of question and answer.
- Google colab demo is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z4WG8Wunj3HE0CERjt608ALSgSzRC9ig?usp=sharing).
- Gradio web demo is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nielsr/donut-docvqa).

#### For (Pseudo) Text Reading Task
The `gt_parse` looks like `{"text_sequence" : "word1 word2 word3 ... "}`
- This task is also a pre-training task of Donut model.
- You can use our **SynthDoG** üê∂ to generate synthetic images for the text reading task with proper `gt_parse`. See `./synthdog/README.md` for details.

### Training

This is the configuration of Donut model training on [CORD](https://github.com/clovaai/cord) dataset used in our experiment. 
We ran this with a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

```bash
python train.py --config config/train_cord.yaml \
                --pretrained_model_name_or_path "naver-clova-ix/donut-base" \
                --dataset_name_or_paths '["naver-clova-ix/cord-v2"]' \
                --exp_version "test_experiment"    
  .
  .

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
